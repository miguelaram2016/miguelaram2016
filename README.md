# Hi there 👋

## I'm a 26-year-old developer. I love programming stuff 😁

I currently work as an independent web developer, helping my clients integrate their frontend and backend code, making everything look perfect 👌🏼

In my free time, I like to [create](https://mig.is-a.dev). Here's a few of my favourite projects, creations, and/or hustles!

- [elmarfitness.com](https://www.elmarfitness.com): Website to introduce my fitness coaching clients to myself and my work 💪🏼
- [marshallbenson.com](https://www.marshallbenson.com): My client needed help integrating their frontend (Squarespace) and backend (Azure), and the result was this beautiful website showcasing his work and upcoming performances 🤘🏼
