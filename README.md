# Hi there 👋

## I'm a 27-year-old developer who loves building random (hopefully useful) things 😁

I currently work as a Manager at a locally owned business, and on the side as a Fitness Consultant.
As an independent Web (wanna-be Software) developer, I enjoy helping my clients integrate their frontend and backend code, making everything look perfect 👌🏼

In my free time, I like to [create](https://mig.is-a.dev). Here's a few of my favourite projects, creations, and/or hustles!

- [elmarfitness.com](https://www.elmarfitness.com): Website to introduce my fitness coaching clients to myself and my work 💪🏼
- [marshallbenson.com](https://www.marshallbenson.com): My client needed help integrating their frontend (Squarespace) and backend (Azure), and the result was this beautiful website showcasing his work and upcoming performances 🤘🏼

My current education/certifications:

- [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/migglenero/machine-learning-with-python-v7): Through extensive learning modules and unit tests, I earned my certification from FreeCodeCamp 🖥️
- [Generative AI Fundamentals](https://credentials.databricks.com/052cc354-c947-42d8-81bb-40c38d77ace3#acc.B2op0GxP): Databricks help me solidify my understanding of the basics of Gen AI 🖥️
- Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology, University of Texas at Austin: In 2021, I finished my degree with a minor in Portuguese and extensive coursework in Math, Physics, Anatomy, and Biomechanics 💪🏼
